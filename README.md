### Project Overview:
This project implements a machine learning approach to classify breast cancer cases as malignant or benign using a Logistic Regression model. The process begins by importing necessary libraries and datasets, followed by data preprocessing, including labeling the target variable. Exploratory analysis helps understand the feature distribution and relationships within the data. After splitting the data into training and test sets, a Logistic Regression model is trained to classify breast cancer cases. The model’s performance is evaluated on both training and testing datasets, and its accuracy is reported.

### Final Conclusion:
The Logistic Regression model achieves high accuracy in classifying breast cancer cases, demonstrating the reliability of this method for medical diagnoses. Training and testing accuracy scores reflect that the model generalizes well to unseen data, reducing overfitting concerns. This success indicates that simple algorithms like Logistic Regression can be effectively employed in early cancer detection, especially when trained on well-prepared datasets. The model’s predictions help distinguish between malignant and benign cases, potentially supporting clinicians in making informed decisions. Future work could explore other algorithms or feature selection methods to further enhance classification accuracy and robustness.
